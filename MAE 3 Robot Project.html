						<h1>Introduction to Engineering Graphics and Design (MAE 3) Robot Project</h1>

							<h2>The Project</h2>
							<p>As the final project of the MAE 3 Introduction to Engineering Graphics and Design Course, the robot project tested my engineering, leadership, communication, and organizational skills. In 5 weeks, me and my team needed to build a robot that can lift small balls and blocks from 7 to 15 inches above the ground and move across a 27 in. x 35 in. area. The robot was built with acrylic, four small geared motors, and two aluminum axles.</p>

							<h2>The Lift</h2>
							<p>The component of the robot that I was responsible for was the lift mechanism. The three goals I sought to achieve were: the component needs to be able to move the rack element and claw component at least 4 inches upwards within 2 seconds, the lift should allow the controller to adjust to any variable height between its resting position and a height of 4 inches, and both racks need to remain parallel to and level with one another. With my design, I was able to accomplish a factor of safety of 4.2 and, through a quasi-static analysis, I determined that the maximum mass that the lift component could support was 0.154 kg.</p>

							<h2>Design Process</h2>
							<p>Assigning roles through the Gantt chart ensured that all team members were productive during their time in the design studio. The chart also helped my team set an order of magnitude in regards to what needed to be completed within the week. This organization helped us designate how many team members to allot for a task and what tasks should be completed first. Beyond the Gantt chart and outside of design studio hours, consistently writing out in detail what needs to be done in our group chat was also important in maximizing the time we had in the design studio. In the group chat, we would organize roles down to the fabrication of individual parts (e.g. cutting and drilling L-brackets or preparing a file for the Lasercamm) to ensure that no time is being wasted. Overall, despite the numerous complications my team faced over the course of these 6 weeks, regular prioritization and scheduling of tasks was vital in completing the project.</p>
