						<h1>Introduction to Engineering Graphics and Design (MAE 3) Pendulum Project</h1>
							<h2>Why the Pendulum?</h2>
							<p>The pendulum project centers around the analysis and construction of the escapement wheel and pendulum. The project aims to educate students on design philosophies and mechanical skills, such as the fabrication and the assembly of parts through the use of drill presses, power drills, taper taps, and the Lasercamm. The pendulum project also serves to help students learn the numerous functions of Fusion 360 and AutoCAD for design and analysis. The main concepts of this project include the mechanical purpose of the escapement wheel, which locks and pushes the pendulum to swing back and forth, and the counterweights, which allow the pendulum to overcome friction by creating a moment, and concepts of physics, including the forces acting upon the pendulum, the moment of inertia of the pendulum, and the period/frequency at which the pendulum swings.</p>

							<h2>Two Methods of Analysis</h2>
							<p>In the timing analysis of the pendulum clock, two theoretical methods were utilized. The first method is the point mass assumption, which condenses the mass of the pendulum to a single point and uses the length of the center of mass as the length of the pendulum. This method of analysis assumes that the pendulum is frictionless, that the pendulum swings with a small angle of oscillation, that the mass of the pendulum is concentrated at a point, that the rope does not stretch, and that the frequency is not affected by the pendulum’s contact with the escapement wheel. The second theoretical method used was the rigid body assumption. The rigid body assumption takes the shape of the pendulum, and thus rotational inertia, into account. However, this method still assumes that the pendulum is frictionless, that the pendulum swings with a small angle of oscillation, and that the frequency is not affected by the pendulum’s contact with the escapement wheel.</p>

							<h2>The Results</h2>
							<p>Through mathematical analysis, it was determined that the rigid body assumption proved to be significantly more accurate than the point mass assumption. The true rate of revolution was found to be 9.783 seconds per revolution.The rigid body assumption predicted that the time of one revolution of the escapement wheel would be 9.434 seconds and had an error percentage of 3.70%. The point mass assumption predicted that the time of one revolution of the escapement wheel would be 7.789 seconds and had an error percentage of 25.59%.</p>
